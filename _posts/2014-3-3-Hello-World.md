**Data Science essay**
Data Science is a field that focuses on intepreting data and extracting knowledge from it. Because it requires a lot of specialized and advanced knowledge, the salary range is relatively high. In fact, the estimated salary is about 120,000 dollars per year, with likely range from 90,000 dollars to 172,000 dollars per year. An even further but less likely range is 71 to 256 thousand dollars per year. As mentioned, the knowledge required is relatively advanced, with **data scientist** needing a strong understanding of probability and statistics, which is used to explore and understand data, identify relationships or dependencies between variables, predict furture trends based on past trends, and find patterns and anomalies in data. They also need to know multivariable calculus and linear algebra, not necessarily to interpret data directly, but rather to create machine learnign models which can be very powerful and helpful in their work. In order to create these modeles, **data scientists** need to know how to use software and program. The most common languages used by **data scientists** are Python and R. They may also learn other languages and software like SQL, Java, Julia, SCala, MATLAB, and TensorFlow. Another helpful skill to have are data wrangling, which is preparing data to be further analyzed by organizing all the raw data you have into more helpful mounds of data. With large amounts of data, knowing how to manage databases also becomes important. Cloud computing is also very helpful with all this data as cloud computing provides access to databases, frameworks, languages, and other tools and allows **data scientists** to put all the computation on supercomputers located elsewhere, which is much quicker than running through loads of data on a regular laptop or even high-end personal desktop. Finally, all this raw data needs to be put in a way that is much more legible to everyone who nees to see it. This includes making graphs and clear relations between data. One common way to visualize data is through Microsoft Excel, becuase it contains countless ways for data to be vizualized and manipulated. As such, it is an essential software for **data scientists** to master.
